_Work duration: 4-8 hours_

## Topic: Inheritance

### Objectives:
- Practice with inheritance (is-a relation).
- Experiment with access modifiers in terms of parent-child relation.

### Tasks:

#### - _Basic Level_ (mark 5 || 6):
1. Create 10 classes with their names as first 10 aphabetical letters (A, B, C, D, ... , J).
   Each next class inherits from previous letter class (ex: `B inherits from A, C inherits from B ...`).

2. Each class should have their own String property with corresponding letter as their reference (ex: `class A -> public String a; class B -> String b; ...; class J - public String j;`).

3. Create by an object of each class type and print it in console in a clever way (so that all objects states are showed).

#### - _Medium Level_ (mark 7 || 8):
1. Change all states from previous classes from public access specifiers to protected.

2. Create class X which has a private String name property that should have also a constructor for that X.

3. Add a instance variable of X type to A class as a state and modify the constructor of A from `A(new String("blabla"))` to `A(new String("blabla"), new X("some name"))`.

Checkout for errors if appeared in child classes and try to resolve the issue.

`hint: use super("blabla", x)`.

4. Finally print J and see what states does it have.

#### - _Advanced Level_ (mark 9 || 10):
1. Add initial value to state X from class A. (ex: `protected X x = new X("xxx")`).

Print a object of J and see the result.

2. Go in class D and create also a state with the same name `x` as in class A and give another initial value.

Print the result and checkout if any changes.

3. Now do the same in class H and add to a state x another initial value.

Chackout again if any changes when printing object of class J.

4. Make the property `x` from class `H` private and checkout now if any errors appeared and try to solve them.

`hint: property x is not visible any more in child classes cause of private modifier in most near by hierarchy class containing this state.`
