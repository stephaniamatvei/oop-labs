_Work duration: 4-8 hours_

## Topic: Practice with data structures.

### Objectives:
- Practice more with objects and classes.
- Analize suitable data structure for problem solving.

### Tasks:

- _Advanced Level_ (mark 7 || 8):
    - Write a program which would find if a mathematical expression is correct from the point of view of the parentheses within it (`hint` - use stack to store parentheses).

    - Read the expression from the file attached at this laboratory(`one_expression.txt` ) and print the result if the parentheses are put correct in this expression.

- _Advanced Level_ (mark 9 || 10):
