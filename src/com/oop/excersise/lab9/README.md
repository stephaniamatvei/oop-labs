# Object Oriented Programming - lab #9

_Work duration: 4-8 hours_

## Topic: Java Exceptions

### Objectives:
- Practice with exceptions.
- Classify different kinds of exceptions.
- Practice with desktop applications.

### Tasks:

- _Basic Level_ (mark 5 || 6):
    1. Create an application which will allow the user to calculate the division between 2 numbers. (Using a GUI for Java, ex: JavaFX, Swing, SWT).

    2. You should have 2 inputs for the operands and a button to click for outputing the result. In case there will be any errors regarding the validation of the form you should show the error message somewhere near the result field of the specific input area.

    3. All the inputs should allow to write any symbol from the keyboard. (The numeric values should be parsed in Java, PS. All formating errors should be caught)

- _Medium Level_ (mark 7 || 8):
    1. You should catch the errors from input missing values, arithmetic errors and number parsing from input values.

- _Advanced Level_ (mark 9 || 10):
    1. Create an own exception (UnluckyException which should extend from Exception).

    2. After knowing the values for the second input (divisor), you should throw an UnluckyException in case its value is 13.

    3. Of course this error should also be catched in case it is thrown somewhere in the code and shown in the window.
